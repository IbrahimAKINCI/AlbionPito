            <h1  >History</h1>
            <p>
                My history has began on 2021 on NA with 
                SLOTH alliance on Turkish Guild
                (BOSPHORUS) played there around few months
            </p>

            <p>
                I gave a break for 2 years just 
                I didn't want to play
            </p>

            <p>
                Started again from zero on 2023
                Joined a guild called Quia Aeternus
            </p>

            <p>
                I played with them around 2 years

                Sometimes we laughed, sometimes
                 we had fun, but every story has
                 an ending. 

                I left the guild on 2024
                I wanted to play on zvz guild
                I chose pro bono played there 5 months
                I had a lot of fun, but I wanted to
                play with my friends again

                I left the guild and joined The 
                Black Coalition which is a my old guild 
                Quia Aeternus
                 but they disbanded after few months

            </p>

            <p>
                Then I deleted the game again
                I didn't play for 4 months

                One day I saw a ad on youtube
                It was about Albion Online
                I thought why not, I can try it again
                I downloaded the game and started

                When I came back I talked with my old guild leader
                janebronze he was also lookng for a guild
                We decided to join a guild together which is mutiny
            </p>

            <p>
                mutiny although mainly english based guild
                has a lot of turkish players
                I played there around 2 months
            </p>

            <p>
                Then heard about a guild re-creating Fake engage 
                which is Futuristic although didn't play much game 
                on that time I heard their name a lot
                We decided to join them janebronze, t1rcks and I

                We played there around 2 months
                Then I left the guild because of not enough activity

            </p>

            <p>
                I joined Wraith which is enemy and ally of Fake Engage
                I played there around 2 months
                Then guild disbanded because of not enough activity
            </p>

            <p>
                Then I joined Fake Engage again
                They accepted me and I still playing there
                
            </p>

            <p>
